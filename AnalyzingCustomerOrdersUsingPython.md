# Course-End Project  
## Analyzing Customer Orders Using Python  

---

### 🧩 Overview  
In this project, you will analyze customer orders using Python data structures to classify products, identify customer purchasing patterns, and generate business insights.  

This analysis will help you understand:  
- Which products are most popular  
- Which customers are high-value  
- How purchase behavior varies across categories  

You will use **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**, along with **loops** and **conditionals**, to process and organize customer order data efficiently.

### 🧠 Instructions  
**Submission:**  
Submit a comprehensive report including:  
- Customer classification  
- Product category analysis  
- Key business insights  

**Tools:**  
- Python (for data processing and analysis)  

**Dataset:**  
- Predefined set of customer orders stored in lists, tuples, and dictionaries

### 💼 Situation  
You are working as a data analyst for an e-commerce company. Your task is to process and analyze customer orders to generate meaningful insights.  

The company sells products across multiple categories such as **Electronics**, **Clothing**, and **Home Essentials**.  
You will determine:  
- Frequently purchased products  
- Customer spending classification  
- Most profitable product categories  

To achieve this, store, categorize, and analyze customer purchase data using **Python’s built-in data structures** and **control structures**.  

The final output will help business managers make data-driven decisions regarding marketing and inventory management.

### 🧾 Tasks  

#### 1. Store Customer Orders  
- Create a list of customer names  
- Store each customer’s order details (name, product, price, category) as tuples inside a list  
- Use a dictionary where keys are customer names and values are lists of ordered products  

#### 2. Classify Products by Category  
- Use a dictionary to map each product to its category  
- Create a set of unique product categories  
- Display all available categories  

#### 3. Analyze Customer Orders  
- Use loops to calculate each customer’s total spending  
- Classification criteria:  
  - **Above $100:** High-value buyer  
  - **$50–$100:** Moderate buyer  
  - **Below $50:** Low-value buyer  

#### 4. Generate Business Insights  
- Calculate total revenue per product category using a dictionary  
- Extract unique products using sets  
- Use list comprehension to find customers who purchased electronics  
- Identify top 3 highest-spending customers  

#### 5. Organize and Display Data  
- Print a summary of each customer’s total spending and classification  
- Use set operations to find customers purchasing from multiple categories  
- Identify customers who bought both Electronics and Clothing
