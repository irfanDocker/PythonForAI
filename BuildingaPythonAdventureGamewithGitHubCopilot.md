# Course-End Project  
## Building a Python Adventure Game with GitHub Copilot  

---

### 🧩 Overview  
In this project, you will build a **text-based adventure game** using **Python** and **GitHub Copilot**.  

The game will allow users to:  
- Explore different locations  
- Make choices that affect gameplay  
- Complete a simple quest  

You’ll focus on core Python concepts such as:  
- Variables  
- Lists  
- Loops  
- Conditionals  
- Functions  

GitHub Copilot will assist you in writing functions and improving code efficiency.  
By completing this project, you’ll reinforce your Python skills in a fun, interactive way.  

---

### 🧰 Tool  
- **VS Code** with **GitHub Copilot** extension  

### 📂 Dataset  
- None  

---

### 🧠 Instructions  
1. Read the *Situation*, *Tasks and Actions*, and *Result* sections carefully.  
2. Follow the provided tasks and actions to build your game.  
3. Create a brief **report (PDF)** that summarizes:  
   - How GitHub Copilot helped generate or optimize your code  
   - Key challenges you faced  
   - Enhancements or modifications you made to your original structure  
4. Submit the project and report via the **Learning Management System (LMS)**.

### 💼 Situation  
You are a Python programmer practicing **functions** and **conditionals**.  
Your goal is to create a **text-based adventure game** where players explore, encounter challenges, and complete a quest.  

GitHub Copilot will assist in:  
- Generating starter functions  
- Suggesting logic for user choices  
- Improving structure and readability  

The final game should be an **interactive command-line (CLI)** program allowing users to make choices and navigate through the story.

### 🕹️ Game Concept  
In this adventure game, the player takes on the role of an explorer searching for a legendary treasure hidden in an ancient land.  

They must:  
- Navigate various challenges  
- Make strategic decisions  
- Overcome obstacles  

Each choice changes the storyline outcome:  
- Some bring the player closer to victory  
- Others lead to failure or restarts  

The world features multiple paths — such as a **dense forest** and a **mysterious cave** — with decision-based scenarios.  

---

### 🧾 Tasks and Actions  

#### **Task 1: Set up the Project**  
**Actions:**  
- Open VS Code and create a new project folder  
- Inside, create a file named `adventure_game.py`  
- Add an inline comment describing the script’s purpose  
- Use a simple `print()` statement to confirm setup  

---

#### **Task 2: Create a Function to Start the Game**  
**Actions:**  
- Define a function `start_game()` to introduce the story  
- Ask the player for their name and store it in a variable  
- Present the player with their first choice — explore the forest or enter the cave  
- Use **GitHub Copilot** to help generate the function body  

---

#### **Task 3: Create the Forest Path**  
**Actions:**  
- Define `forest_path()` to describe the forest scenario  
- Provide options (e.g., *follow a river* or *climb a tree*)  
- Use **if-else** statements to handle each decision  

---

#### **Task 4: Create the Cave Path**  
**Actions:**  
- Define `cave_path()` to describe the cave scenario  
- Provide choices (e.g., *light a torch* or *proceed in the dark*)  
- Use conditionals to determine the outcome  

---

#### **Task 5: Run the Adventure Game**  
**Actions:**  
- Call `start_game()` to begin  
- Ensure the program runs in a loop until the quest ends  
- Offer a **restart option** after completion  

---

### 🧩 Game Endings  
The game can conclude in three ways:  
1. 🏆 **Winning** – Finding the treasure  
2. 💀 **Losing** – Making a poor decision that ends the game  
3. 🔁 **Restarting** – Choosing to replay after failure  

---

### 🎯 Result  
Your deliverable will be:  
- A working **`adventure_game.py`** script that runs a fully functional text-based game  
- A **PDF report** summarizing GitHub Copilot’s role, your challenges, and improvements  

Submit both via the **LMS**.
